# Todo List App

- This app is a bare-bones version of a todo list, where users can add/edit/delete todos.
- Edit functionality supports changing of todo name and set a priority, by default the priority is set to "Medium".
- Users can select the checkbox to change the status to complete, unchecking it will revert this status.
- Sorting ascending/descending can be done on two columns - Name & Priority by clicking the table column headers.

## Further possible enhancements
- Use a UI library like material-ui for better UI/UX and this removes native html boilerplate
- Provide validation, error and confirmation messages
- Provide popups instead of inline editing
- Use Cypress for e2e testing + accessibility
